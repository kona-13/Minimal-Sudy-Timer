# Minimal-Timer
Minimalist version of Timer w/ built in 45 min Pomodoro timer.

Minimal countdown timer with user input and a set timer for pomodoro study sessions (tailored to my study sessions of 45 mins focused, then 15 min breaks).
1.) Start - this is the user input mode.
2.) Start with pomodoro timer (45 mins) - this is the pomodoro mode.
3.) Exit - to exit the application.

Working on for ver 1.2:
- Pause/unpause functionality
- Cancel/return to main screen while running functionality.
