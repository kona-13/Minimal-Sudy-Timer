# Minimal-Study-Timer
Minimalist version of Timer w/ built in 45 & 50 min Pomodoro timer.

Minimal countdown timer with user input and a set timer for pomodoro study sessions (tailored to my personal study sessions).
1.) Start - this is the user input mode. - User input for hour followed by minutes followed by seconds.
2.) Start with pomodoro timer (45 mins) - this is the 45 min w/ 15 min break pomodoro mode.
3.) Start with pomodoro timer (50 mins) - this is the 50 min w/ 10 min break pomodoro mode.
4.) Exit - to exit the application.


Versions:
- ver 1.12 - added 50 min timer
- ver 1.13 - removed repeat option so it auto repeats (might add these as seperate options instead of replacing entirely in next build - will see how it goes)

Working on for ver 1.2:
- Pause/unpause functionality
- Cancel/return to main screen while running functionality.
- Count and display number of sessions.

Feel free to use and modify to your preferences.
